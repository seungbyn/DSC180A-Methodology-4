## Brainstorm for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I think the most interesting topic we covered is how the already built LLMs are being used in conjunctions with each other. The LLMs seem to almost "talk" to each other. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to explore validating the Causal Analysis Copilot with a real-world dataset and seeing if I can make any tweaks to the parameters to increase efficiency. 

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One potential change I would have made would be to have tested validation on a real-world dataset and see how that compares to a simualted dataset.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would interested in applying ML or learning about the techniques used to utilize AI/ML in the financial industry
